title: EditableText
description: EditableText is a component that allows users to edit text inline. It displays the text in a non-editable state by default, but when the user clicks the edit icon, it switches to an editable input field where the user can make changes. Once the user is done editing, they can click outside the input field or press the enter key to save the changes. The component uses the ControlInput component to display the input field and passes the value and onChange props to it.
