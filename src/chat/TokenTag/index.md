## Default

The remaining tokens are calculated based on the `maxValue` and `value` props. The component has three types of visual styles: normal (ðŸ˜€), low (ðŸ˜…), and overload (ðŸ¤¯), which are determined by the percentage of remaining tokens. The component is memoized for performance optimization.
