description: The FluentEmoji component is used to display an emoji with the Fluent design style. It supports different types of styles (modern, flat, high-contrast) and sizes. It also provides a loading spinner when the image is being fetched from the server, and a fallback text emoji when the image fails to load. The component is customizable with className and style props, and can receive additional props to be passed down to the underlying div element.
